Problem description:
Given an integer array, find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing 
subsequence should be at least 2 .
The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.

Solutions:
(1) Iterate every element, each as a starting point (reference), use a HashMap to avoid duplicate. 
(2) Then check each element after the reference point to decide whether it is a unique (also use HashMap to check) increasing subsequence. 
Recursively implement the process, use a list of list to record the result.
