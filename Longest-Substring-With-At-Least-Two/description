Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most 2 distinct characters.
For example, Given s = “eceba”,
T is "ece" which its length is 3.


Solution:
Iterate through the string, denote the position of string as i, maintain several variables, to record:
(1) What these two distinct characters are;
(2) What is the largest index of these two characters;
(3) The smallest index that the sub string in this index to current index to meet the two-distinct-character requirement, denoted as start. 

In each iteration, update the max length as maxlen = max(maxlen, i-start+1)
