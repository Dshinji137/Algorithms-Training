Description:
You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.

Example 1:
Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].


Solution:
It is really a tricky one, but can be solved with elegant way.
According to the description, we need to find the smallest range covering at least one element of every list. 
Because every list is sorted, we can keep a window, initially let the window cover each listâ€™s smallest element (i.e. list(0)), then slide the window by discarding the smallest number in the window and import the next number of the list who contributes to the smallest number.When the number cannot hold N (# lists) number, indicating there is no more window to cover all lists, the sliding is done.
